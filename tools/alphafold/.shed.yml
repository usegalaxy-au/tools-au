description: "Alphafold v2: AI-guided 3D structure prediction of proteins"

long_description: |
    Alphafold is a program which uses neural networks to predict the tertiary (3D) structure of proteins. Alphafold accepts amino acid sequence(s) in FASTA format, which will then be 'folded' into a predicted 3D model. The tool can fold monomers (single proteins) and multimers (a complex of proteins).
